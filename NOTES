looking for Executor or Runnable


We're going to instrument the constructor of a Runnable.
so:
  if the class is abstract, then it's not a Runnable.
  if the class implements Runnable, then Yes Runnable.
  if the class has a run() then Maybe Runnable
  if the class doesn't have a run(), but extends another class, then maybe Runnable

if the class has a execute() then Maybe Executor
if the class impl Executor, then Yes Executor
